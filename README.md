# Kenny K. Portfolio 2019 After General Assembly Sept 16 - Dec 12, 2019

This my current portfolio for what I have completed so far.

Technologies used.
Your process/approach.
Unsolved problems.
Your biggest wins and challenges.
Screenshots of the snippets of code you used to solve particularly interesting problems (think code highlights).


Technologies used are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Node.js, MONGODB, MONGOD, MONGO, jQuery, Python, Django, React, and more in the class so far.

Process approach was to have my current updated projects to set into the portofolio, I will be adding in the remainder once they go live and have a clickable url on the picture itself.

Unsolved, currently I need to make heroku for the remainder of the portfolio's.

Biggest challenge was the wireframe itself. How I wanted my portofio to look like. I will be changing the whole thing when I have more time to make it more professional and appealing.
